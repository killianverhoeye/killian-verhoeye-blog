| General topic? | The key role of ice slabs in the sea level rise |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The purpose of this study is to analyze the manner how ice slabs participate to the sea level rise. For this they used radar observation. Moreover, computer simulations of future climate conditions was used to predict the ice slab’s expansion |
| Conclusions/discovery? | Ice slab = Impermeable ice layer (1m – 16m of thickness) due to the refreeze of meltwater during winter. Consequences on sea level : * Meltwater can flow on the ice slab and directly leak in the sea because it functions as a barrier to percolating meltwater. * Due to that, increase of 74 cm until 2100.Predictions (until 2100) : * Under the lower greenhouse gas emission scenario : ice slab’s evolution will slow down. * Under the highest future emissions scenario : ice slabs could extent as far as the center of ice sheet |
| Remaining questions? | Scientists don’t know how ice slabs, meltwater and ice sheet interact. So, the next step is to answer to this question |
